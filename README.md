# 🧙‍♂️ Contract Necromancer 🧙‍♂️  
**Bringing lost insurance contracts back from the dead!**  

## ⚰️ The Tragic Tale  
Once upon a time, in the depths of the **Imdad system**, an insurance contract was lost—swallowed by the void, never to be seen again. The insurance team faced a grim fate: reprocessing everything from scratch. Hours of tedious work. Endless suffering.  

But then, a hero emerged. **Me.** 😎  

With a bit of Python sorcery 🐍✨ and web scraping magic, I created **Contract Necromancer**, a tool that **revives** lost contracts from the system, reversing its dark rituals (a.k.a. data processing) and restoring the original contract to its former glory.  

## 🛠️ How to Summon the Contract Necromancer  

1. **Install the sacred dependencies:**  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Prepare the ritual:**  
   - Open `config.py` and insert:  
     - Your **COOKIE** 🍪  
     - The **BASE URL** of the Imdad system 🌐  

3. **Summon the contract:**  
   - Open `main.py` and specify:  
     - `company_id` (the insurance company's ID)  
     - `company_name` (because every soul needs a name)  

4. **Step back and witness the resurrection!** ☠️  

## 🔮 Behold the Magic  
With just a few incantations (and by "incantations," I mean Python scripts), your lost contract **returns from the void, fully intact.** No more reprocessing. No more suffering.  

## ⚠️ Use With Caution  
**This tool holds great power.** With it, you can defy the system's rules and restore what was lost. But remember: **with great power comes great responsibility.** 🕸️
